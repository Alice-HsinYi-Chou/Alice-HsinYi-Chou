## Intro
#### ME 
A human being with 24y of life experiences and wisdom that she barely recalls half of them. The glass is half full...right?
Try to treasure life with good intentions, on-point skills and wholesome people. Perhaps by the time I get knocked out by it, dignity and contentment are on my side. (Hopefully, some cherished memories and luaghters accompany you) 
Before that, I‚Äôm always a work in progress.
Guidance and support are very welcomed (tbh, NEEDED).  

#### My Extension
I‚Äôm a graduate who finished studying physiotherapy in Taiwan.
The incredibleness of the human body has always intrigued me. I was initially drawn to the capability of the body to perform various movements, especially in sports. Physio training does well fulfilling my curiosity. In the uni, I was lucky to be exposed to the knowledge of the human brain and mind. Especially nowadays, with the aid of brain scans and other equipment to measure or observe our brain more timely or accurately, I was extremely fascinated by these. Afterwards, I was fascinated by the product of the human mind. The thinking and reasoning in philosophy add a bit more flavor in my life. 
Overall, I‚Äôm so grateful that as physio that we can peek into different stages of life. From the infant & toddler stage to the late stage when humans are neither eagerly postponing nor waiting for the final call in life.
